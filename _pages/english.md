## What is it?
This site offers a collection of my userscripts and tools for [Operation Portal Recon](https://opr.ingress.com/), designed to help you review and manage nominations faster and more efficiently.
All listed extensions aim to improve the OPR experience and make everyday tasks easier.

Please note: These projects are unofficial and not affiliated with NianticSpatial or Recon.
Use them at your own risk.
